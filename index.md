# Welcome to my Dung Nguyen's Github page

## Introduction

I am finishing my senior at a small liberal art college and conducting research some research on perception from an embodied cognition approach. My plan is to travel around the world and then pursue a higher degree in Quantitative Psychology. 

I'm working on this Github Page. I expect to reformat it and fill it with some boring contents about research in psychology, some statistics and linear algebra.

All public repositories can be viewed here:
